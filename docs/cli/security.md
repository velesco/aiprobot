## Audit

```bash
aipro security audit
aipro security audit --deep
aipro security audit --fix
```

The audit warns when multiple DM senders share the main session and recommends **secure DM mode**: `session.dmScope="per-channel-peer"` (or `per-account-channel-peer` for multi-account channels) for shared inboxes.
It also warns when small models (`<=300B`) are used without sandboxing and with web/browser tools enabled.
