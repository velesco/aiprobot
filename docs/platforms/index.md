# Platforms

AIPro core is written in TypeScript. **Node is the recommended runtime**.
Bun is not recommended for the Gateway (WhatsApp/Telegram bugs).

Companion apps exist for macOS (menu bar app) and mobile nodes (iOS/Android). Windows and
Linux companion apps are planned, but the Gateway is fully supported today.
Native companion apps for Windows are also planned; the Gateway is recommended via WSL2.

## Common links

- Install guide: [Getting Started](/start/getting-started)
- Gateway runbook: [Gateway](/gateway)
- Gateway configuration: [Configuration](/gateway/configuration)
- Service status: `aipro gateway status`

## Gateway service install (CLI)

Use one of these (all supported):

- Wizard (recommended): `aipro onboard --install-daemon`
- Direct: `aipro gateway install`
- Configure flow: `aipro configure` → select **Gateway service**
- Repair/migrate: `aipro doctor` (offers to install or fix the service)

The service target depends on OS:

- macOS: LaunchAgent (`bot.molt.gateway` or `bot.molt.<profile>`; legacy `com.aipro.*`)
- Linux/WSL2: systemd user service (`aipro-gateway[-<profile>].service`)
